This problem was asked by Twitter.

Problem statement:
==================
You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

-  record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
-  get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

Fore thought:
============
Data structures in this case is used for the Relational Database Management System (Array of structure). so, possible structure where all entries 
must be of the same data type such as list can be classified into linear and non-linear data structures.
Although not the best at efficency, linear data structures contain Stacks and Queues fits the requiremnts.
Otherwise, non-linear data structure such as a hash table would be more efficient.

Stack is a container of objects that can be inserted or removed according to LIFO (Last in First Out) pop() method is used during disposal in Python
Should we use a stack?  Built-in list is a stack.  So, it is still a list.  The biggest issue is that it can run into speed issues as it grows. The items in a list are stored with the goal of providing fast access to random elements in the list. At a high level, this means that the items are stored next to each other in memory.
If your stack grows bigger than the block of memory that currently holds it, then Python needs to do some memory allocations. This can lead to some .append() calls taking much longer than other ones.
There is a less serious problem as well. If you use .insert() to add an element to your stack at a position other than the end, it can take much longer. 
We should never use list for any data structure that can be accessed by multiple threads. list is not thread-safe.

Next best thing is a queue.  A queue is a FIFO (First in First Out) data structure.  It is a linear data structure that can be accessed by multiple threads.
Still, both stacks and queues are stored in blocks of contiguous memory.  

Fortunately, the constant time .append() and .pop() operations make deque an excellent choice for implementing a Python stack if your code doesnâ€™t use threading.
While the built-in library interface for list and deque were similar, LifoQueue uses .put() and .get() to add and remove data from the stack.

Implementations:
----------------
1.  Bruteforce approach: Singly linked list
2.  Use a stack to store the last N order_ids
3.  Use a queue to store the last N order_ids
4.  Use a deque to store the last N order_ids
