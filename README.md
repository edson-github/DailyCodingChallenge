## Solutions for Daily Coding Challenge

Sign up for an account at <a href>"https://dailycodingproblem.com"</a> to automatically receive  a daily coding problem in your mail box.


This post contains continuous update of my solutions (code snippets).  I try to keep it a consistent activity as a way to keep my mind entertained.  


## How to Run

** 1.  Install pytest (pip install  pytest)

** 2.  git clone this project

** 3.  Run pytest (pytest ./*.py)

**     or, execute individual python solution (python codechalleng-##.py)

## Organization

One problem/solution per python file.
Each python file contains the given problem in the commented section and my attempted code below it.  The files are not linked or referenced to one another.  However, you could run pytest on the entire directory.  Be sure to open it up and read it.  

Feel free to suggest better performance for any of my solution here.
